Project Overview

Project Background: 
The purpose of this project is to build a hands-on learning experience for beginning programmers that are learning Java. This project will be to develop a 2D RPG style game that incorporates minimal coding from the user to guide them through the experience. The premise of the game is that the character is pulled into their programming project and must try to escape. Armed with nothing but her/his tablet the character is guided through multiple programming dilemmas where the user must correctly input code snippets to proceed. 

Users:
Students K-12 
Teachers 
Parents 


Assumptions:
One assumption of this project is that users will be learning Java programming outside of this game. This game is to provide an interactive and “fun” way to assist the learning process. It will also be assumed that the user will be able to follow simple instructions in order to facilitate learning.  

Scope of Work to Complete

Features to be developed:
There will be a start-up menu to start a new game or load a saved game. This will be dependent on the ability to create and store a saved file. 

The system will load images for the visuals of the game. 

Player movement via user input. Which is dependent on the user having an input device. 

Guided text-based coding inputs from the user. Which is dependent on pop-up text boxes in the program and user text input from device.

Features that will not be developed:
This project will not have the capacity for learning in other programming languages. Similarly, the project will not have different levels of learning capabilities other than that of the introductory level. 

Team Communication

Forms of Communication:
Our group has decided to communicate through a personal server on the Discord website. Through Discord, we will be able to quickly send information back and forth regarding any problems, changes or concerns that we may have regarding the project. We will also be communicating through email on a need-to basis as well as in-person. As of right now, there are no specific preferred times or any times where communication should be avoided within the group.

Meetings:
We have all decided to have our meeting in-person. Since we all have at least one class in the Engineering building, and it is a location that has computer labs available for us to use, we have considered it to be a possible meeting location. Another possible location would be the on-campus library. The library also has computers available and many other resources such as whiteboards and textbooks that are accessible to us. Our goal is to have meetings periodically so that we are all on the right track and to make sure that everyone is included. One specific time we will meet is briefly after our class meeting time. During our longer meetings, we will alternate the role of taking notes. If a person is unable to attend a meeting, they will be caught up through Discord and notified on what has been added to Trello.

Writing:
Writing of the Software documentation will be done as a unit. Decisions on what is written and how we will design will first be discussed in personal meetings at which point any documentation needed for the project at that time will be sectioned and assign in an equal amount, or as equal as possible. For example, for the SRS we will meet to make concrete decisions on our system requirements and design at that point sections will be decided and assigned. The above-described method of documentation writing/distribution should all for equal writing responsibilities as well as equal responsibility distribution for our entire project.

File Sharing:
Files will be shared on Trello, Google Drive, and Github. Trello will be used to add file attachments relating to an Epic, Task or Story. This could include proof that the code is functioning properly or possible bugs within the code. Google Drive will contain all of our written documentation and any other different types of files that need to be accessible to every group member. We will have a shared folder that we are all able to access and make changes at any point during the development of the project. Github will be used as our version control for sharing source code. Github will allow us to create a repository for our project and make commits to the project. This will help us keep up with our progress during the duration of the development of the project.

Probation and Termination from Group (Do Not Alter)

It should never be up to a subset of a group to carry the entire load for a project. To avoid such situations, multiple checks have been put into place. In the worst cases, there may come a need when the group must fire an individual who is failing to carry their weight. The following are valid reasons for firing an individual from a group:
Failing to contribute an equal share to group endeavors; failing to provide your group with the agreed upon portion of your assignment while meeting the appropriate requirements.
Failing to communicate appropriately and effectively with group members.
Failing to attend agreed upon group meetings. Being on-time and attending all group meetings is necessary to progressing smoothly through the project.
Failing to work cohesively and effectively with other group members.
Gossiping about other group members. Be respectful to your peers.
Consistently displaying a negative attitude regarding other members of the assigned group or group assignment.
Missing an agreed upon deadline.
Failure of a group member to effectively communicate and work with other members of the group serves to hold back a group’s progress. Furthermore, when a subset of the group is left to carry the entire workload, the results of the entire group suffer. A group that feels that a group member is causing chronic problems may present a case of termination of the group member by completing the following procedures:
An email identifying the aforementioned criteria that was violated must be sent to the offending group member. This email should be summative and objective. It should useful respectful language and not attack the group member. The course professor should be cc’d on the email.
The offending group member must respond to each email within 48 hours. The contents of this email should be a confirmation of receiving the email and include how they will address the concern in the future.
After two warnings, the group will meet privately with the course professor to discuss the situation and to attempt to identify a possible solution. Furthermore, if the course professor feels that the problem stated in the previously sent emails were valid, the offending group member will be put on probation.
If the group member on probation receives another notice from the group, the group member will be terminated from the group and receive a 0 on the project. Note that a 0 on the project, indicates that the highest grade obtainable in the project is a “D”.
This policy was not put into place to create conflicts within a group. The purpose of this policy is to protect the group and the group’s projects from individual abuse, and to prevent situations that arise where a group must pick up the slack of other members. Internal problems within a group should be handled professionally by the group, insults and disrespectful behavior such as gossip will not be tolerated. This policy is to be used when all other attempts to encourage group participation have been exhausted and should be used only as a last-ditch effort to encourage the group to work in a cohesive many. It is up to the group when and if to employ this policy.
Unnecessary usage of this policy or using this policy to intimidate group members that think differently or do not immediately agree to the consensus of the group will result in the entire group suffering deductions in their final project grade.
